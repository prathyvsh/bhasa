* Bhāṣā

A pattern repository for spatio-temporal languages.

** Rationale
   
Communication between two entities is mediated by a language. This
language could take the form of temporally sequenced frequencies
uttered by taking turns (as in the case of humans), pattern
descriptions in space (in the case of bees), or holes on a punchcard
(spatially distributed pattern). All these share a common basis of
being regularities distributed across either time or space.

This library is an attempt at identifying, collecting, and curating
such patterns that occur in our day to day work in graphics,
animation, and user interface design which we think will find it's
relevance across other forms of languages.
